multiple phases, can be pulled into another phase by monsters or phase in/out class dependant. can attempt to prevent phase shifting or let it happen

phases have types and certain properties. being able to enter or refuse to enter requires mastery of that phase. eg. knowledge phase tests your knowledge of the world around you (asks a random question about the universe). If you can demonstrate mastery, your chance of entering/exiting or refusing entry is increased (or decreased if not).
